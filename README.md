# Ansible UpCloud Collection

UpCloud inventory as a modernized Ansible collection. Currently scope only covers UpCloud's servers offering,
but depending on the demand we might include our other services (networks, (object) storages, routers, databases etc)
in it as well. If you find yourself needing a specific service as an inventory, please open an 
[issue](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-ansible-collection/issues). Please see the development & contribution
sections below for development quickstart if you're interested in adding new features or making fixes.
